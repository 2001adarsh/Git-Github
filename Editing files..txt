This is my first file.
Ready to get commit or lets say to be added.

--First Edit to done.
	how to do it
		-> git status will give the modified signal
	git add first.txt
now, 	git status 
		->will tell that the file has been modified.
	since, changing is a two step process
	git commit -m "Modified first.txt"
yay,thats it about editing files.
